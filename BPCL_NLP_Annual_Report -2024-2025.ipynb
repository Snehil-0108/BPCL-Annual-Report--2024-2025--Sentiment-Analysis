BPRL capitalises the obligations for removal and restoration that are incurred during a particular\\nperiod as a consequence of having undertaken the exploration for and evaluation of mineral\\nresources and the amount of provision required to be created for subsequent abandonment as\\npart of Property, Plant and Equipment or Intangible Assets, as the case may be. The provision for\\nestimated abandonment costs is made at current prices considering the environment and social\\nobligations, terms of mining lease agreement, industry practice, etc. Where the effect of the time\\nvalue of money is material, the amount of the provision is the present value of the expenditures\\nexpected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate (or rates) is pre-tax rate (or\\nrates) that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific\\nto the liability. Where there is an uncertainty of timing on the incurrence of the expenditure, time\\nvalue of money is not considered while providing for the obligations. Changes in the measurement\\nof existing abandonment costs that result from changes in the estimated timing or amount of the\\noutflow of resources embodying economic benefits required to settle the obligation or a change\\nin the discount rate is added to, or deducted from the related field in the current period and is\\nconsidered for necessary depletion (depreciation) prospectively. The change in the estimated\\nprovision due to the periodic unwinding of the discount is recognized in the Consolidated Statement\\nof Profit and Loss as it occurs.\\n400 Bharat Petroleum Corporation
